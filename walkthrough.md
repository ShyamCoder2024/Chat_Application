# Walkthrough - Color Palette Update

I have updated the application's color palette to match the provided design image.

## Changes

### Color Palette
I updated the CSS variables in `client/src/index.css` to reflect the new color scheme:

- **Sage Green**: Updated to `#A1B26C`
- **Warm Yellow**: Updated to `#F4DE79`
- **Soft Blue**: Updated to `#BCC9EB`
- **Soft Pink**: Updated to `#F2B1DC`
- **Cream Background**: Updated to `#FAF2E5`
- **Deep Black**: Updated to `#000000`

### Typography
The application is already configured to use **Nimbus Sans** and **PP Mori** as primary and heading fonts respectively, with **Inter** and **Space Grotesk** as fallbacks. Since no new font files were provided, the application will continue to use these settings.

## Verification Results

### Automated Build
- Ran `npm run build` successfully, confirming no syntax errors in the CSS updates.

### Visual Verification
- The new colors should now be visible throughout the application, providing the requested "brush up" to the design.
